## The infamous donut.c ... but in assembly

I have tried my best to recreate to original [donut.c](https://gist.github.com/gcr/1075131) in x86_64 assembly


## Prerequisites 
- You need to be on a 64-bit Linux distribution
- You need to have nasm and the gcc standard libraries installed
- You can run `prerequisites.sh`to install all necesary dependancies


## Building
- Run the `build.sh` bash file to build the assembly code
- Then just run `./donut` and enjoy the animation
